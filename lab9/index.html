		<h2>Objective:</h2>
		<p> The purpose of the lab was to learn about CSS. We learned about box
			margins and padding. We can also add borders and an outline and are able
			to adjust the height and width.
		</p>
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>One of the diffulties of the lab was making sure the html was working
			and the margins fit right. The best thing to do is to experiment with the
			different types of sizes. The Css file was also loading from the last labs
