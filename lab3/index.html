	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<h2>Objective:</h2>
	<p> The purpose of the lab was to understand the importance of file structure.
		There are certain hierarchies pertaining to parent, child, and siblings folders and files.
		It is also important to name the files right like not including spaces or special characters.
	</p>
	<h3>Difficulties</h3>
	<p>One of the diffulties of the lab was trying to get the picture in the browser to show.
		I had to make sure the naming convention of the image was right.
		For the most part the rest of the lab was fairly simple.
		It was easy to add text to the HTML
