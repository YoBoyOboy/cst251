	<div id="Objective">
		<h2>Objective:</h2>
		<p> The purpose of the lab was to learn about overflow and float<br>
			Overflow can control height, width, borders, and can scroll <br>
			The padding would be between the edges and the content. <br>
			Float can help move elements to where we need them <br>
			Centering is a very difficult or tricky process <br>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Difficulties">
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>One of the diffulties of the lab was making sure the html <br>
			was working and that the image shows up.<br>

		<h3>Floated</h3>
		<p>Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in
			 harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
			 Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when
			  the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my
				brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And
				although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before
				he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.

		<h3> Center-Horizontally</h3>
		<p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden
			base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
			During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
			Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armoured space station with
			enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire’s
			sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian
			of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom
			to the galaxy….
