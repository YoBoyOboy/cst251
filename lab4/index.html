	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
	<h2>Objective:</h2>
	<p> The purpose of the lab was to understand how to file transfer.
		If you store it in the local files you wont be able to access it on the server.
		Server files you can access on the internet. It is best to test files locally.
		We transfer files from local to server using SFTP.
	</p>
	<h3>Difficulties</h3>
	<p>One of the diffulties of the lab was trying transfer files on Github. We solved this
		by collaborating with another group and they helped us navigate through GitHub.
		Other than that the rest of the lab came fairly easy to us
	</p>
