		<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/index.css">
		<h2>Objective:</h2>
		<p> The purpose of the lab was to learn about class and IDs. There can base
			multiple classes but one id. We also learned about block and inline
			where block starts on a new line and takes as much space going from
			left to right. Whereas inline starts does not start on a new line and
			is contain in whats is neccessary. We also leardned about creating forms
			and the different inputs such as input, select, and textarea
		</p>
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>One of the diffulties of the lab was getting our schedules together since
			we were both busy beforehand. We were both confused on the wording of the label
			so we reached out to another group stephanie who helped us.
